Since dawn of time the fate of man is that of lice
Equal as parasites and moving without eyes
A day of reckoning when penance is to burn
Count down together now and say the words that you will learn
Hell Satan, Archangelo
Hell Satan, welcome year zero
Hell Satan, Archangelo
Hell Satan, welcome year zero
Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub
Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer
Crestfallen kings and queens comforting in their faith
Unbeknownst to them is the presence of the wraith
Since fate of man is equal to the fate of lice
As new dawn rises you shalt recognize
Now behold the Lord of Flies
Hell Satan, Archangelo
Hell Satan, welcome year zero
Hell Satan, Archangelo

He will tremble the nations
Kingdoms to fall one by one
Victim to fall for temptations
A daughter to fall for a son
The ancient serpent deceiver
To masses standing in awe
He will ascend to the heavens
Above the stars of God
